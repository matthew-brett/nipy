An implementation of the dimension info as desribed in:

http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/niftilib/nifti1.h

A version of the same file is in the nibabel repisitory at
``doc/source/external/nifti1.h``.

Background
==========

We (nipystas) make an explicit distinction between

* an input coordinate system of an image (the array == voxel coordinates)
* output coordinate system (usually millimeters in some world)
* the mapping between the two.

The collection of these three is the ``coordmap`` attribute of a NIPY image.

There is no constraint that the number of input and output coordinates should be
the same.

We don't specify the units of our output coordinate system, but assume spatial
units are millimeters and time units are seconds.

NIFTI is mostly less explicit, but more constrained.

NIFTI input coordinate system
-----------------------------

NIFTI files can have up to seven voxel dimensions (7 axes in the input
coordinate system).

The first 3 voxel dimensions of a NIFTI file must be spatial but can be in any
order in relationship to directions in mm space (the output coordinate system)

The 4th voxel dimension is assumed to be time.  In particular, if you have some
other meaning for a non-spatial dimension, the NIFTI standard suggests you set
the length of the 4th dimension to be 1, and use the 5th dimension of the image
instead, and set the NIFTI "intent" fields to state the meaning. If the
``intent`` field is set correctly then it should be possible to set meaningful
input coordinate axis names for dimensions > (0, 1, 2).

There's wrinkle to the 4th axis is time story; the ``xyxt_units`` field in the
NIFTI header can specify the 4th dimension units as Hz (frequency),
PPM (concentration) or Radians / second.

NIFTI also has a 'diminfo' header attribute that optionally specifies that 0 or
more of the first three voxel axes are 'frequency', 'phase' or 'slice'.  These
terms refer to 2D MRI acquisition encoding, where 'slice's are collected
sequentially, and the two remaining dimensions arose from frequency and phase
encoding.  The ``diminfo`` fields are often not set.  3D acquisitions don't have
a 'slice' dimension.

NIFTI output coordinate system
------------------------------

In the NIFTI specification, the order of the output coordinates (at least the
first 3) are fixed to be what might be called RAS+, that is ('x=L->R', 'y=P->A',
'z=I->S'). This RAS+ output order is not allowed to change and there is no way of
specifying such a change in the nifti header.

The world in which these RAS+ X, Y, Z axes exist can be one of the recognized
spaces, which are: scanner, aligned (to another file's world space), Talairach,
MNI 152 (aligned to the MNI 152 atlas).

By implication, the 4th output dimension is likely to be seconds (given the 4th
input dimension is likley time), but there's a field ``xyzt_units`` (see above)
that can be used to imply the 4th output dimension is actually frequency,
concentration or angular velocity.

NIFTI input / output mapping
----------------------------

NIFTI stores the relationship between the first 3 (spatial) voxel axes and the
RAS+ coordinates in an *XYZ affine*.  This is a homogenous coordinate affine,
hence 4 by 4 for 3 (spatial) dimensions.

NIFTI also stored "pixel dimensions" in a ``pixdim`` field. This can give you
scaling for individual axes.  We ignore the values of ``pixdim`` for the first 3
axes if we have a full ("sform") affine stored in the header, otherwise they
form part of the affine above.  Later values provide voxel to output calings for
later axes.  The units for the 4th dimension can come from ``xyzt_units`` as
above.

We take the convention that the output coordinate names are ('x=L->R', 'y=P->A',
'z=I->S','t','u','v','w').  The first 3 axes are also named after the output
space ('scanner-x=L->R', 'mni-x=L-R' etc).

What we do about all this
=========================

On saving a NIPY image to NIFTI
-------------------------------

First, we need to create a valid XYZ Affine.  We check if this can be done by
checking if there are recognizable X, Y, Z output axes and corresponding input
(voxel) axes.  This requires the input image to be at least 3D. If we find these
requirements, we reorder the image axes to have XYZ output axes and 3 spatial
input axes first, and get the corresponding XYZ affine.

We check if the XYZ output fits with the the NIFTI named spaces of scanner,
aligned, Talairach, MNI.  If not we raise an error.

Set the ``xyzt_units`` field to indicate millimeters and seconds, if there is a
't' axis, otherwise millimeters and 0 (unknown).

If the non-spatial dimensions are not orthogonal to each other, raise an error.

We look to see if we have an output axis named 't'. If we do, roll that axis to
be the 4th axis. Take the ``affine[3, -1]`` and put into the ``toffset`` field.
If there's no 't' axis, but there are other non-spatial axes, make a length 1
input axis to indicate this.

If there is an axis named any of frequency-hz', 'concentration-ppm' or
'radians/s' and there is no 't' axis, move the axis to the 4th position and set
``xyz_units``.

Set ``pixdim`` for axes >= 3 using vector length of corresponding affine
columns.

If any of the first three input axes are named ('slice', 'freq', 'phase') set
the ``diminfo`` field accordingly.

We don't set the intent-related fields for now.

On loading a NIPY image from NIFTI
----------------------------------

Lacking any other information, we take the input coordinate names for
axes 0:7 to be  ('i', 'j', 'k', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w').

If axis 3 (4th) is length 1 and there are more than 4 dimensions to the input
array, then squeeze the 4th dimension and omit 't' above. If ``xyzt_units``
shows 4th axis to be Hz, PPM or radians / second, set the 4th axis name to
'frequency-hz', 'concentration-ppm' or 'radians/s' respectively.

If there's a 't' axis get ``toffset`` and put into affine at position [3, -1].

If ``diminfo`` is set coherently, set input axis names to 'slice', 'freq',
'phase' from ``diminfo``.

Get the output spatial coordinate names from the 'scanner', 'aligned',
'talairach', 'mni' XYZ spaces (see :mod:`nipy.core.reference.spaces`).

We construct the N-D affine by taking the XYZ affine and adding scaling diagonal
elements from ``pixdim``.

Ignore the intent-related fields for now.

    Given a square affine_transform, return a new 3-dimensional AffineTransform
    and the pixel dimensions in dimensions greater than 3.

    If strict is True, then an exception is raised if the affine matrix is not
    diagonal with positive entries in dimensions greater than 3.

    If strict is True, then the names of the range coordinates must be
    LPS:('x+LR','y+PA','z+SI') or RAS:('x+RL','y+AP','z+SI'). If strict is
    False, and the names are not either of these, LPS:('x+LR','y+PA','z+SI') are
    used.

    If the names are RAS:('x+RL','y+AA','z+SI'), then the affine is flipped so
    the result is in LPS:('x+LR','y+PA','z+SI').
